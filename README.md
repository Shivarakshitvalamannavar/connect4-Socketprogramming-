A simple Connect 4 implementation in Python with web support
Frist we need to have these codes on two different laptops 
Before we proceed any further  we will have to get a certification from openssl(We can get one from Sourceforge.net) and then we can start working with this 
One Device will act as server and the other device can act as the players 
Open the code and configure the ip adresses and port as per your configuration
Note that Both devices should be running on the same network
